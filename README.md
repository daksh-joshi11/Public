DAKSH JOSHI'S PYTHON PROJECTS
***

Self-learning Python! This is a collection of my Python projects.
***

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

18IMFPapersPublic.py: This web-scraping program automatically extracts IMF research papers based on the topic/author/field of interest, and then feeds its details, summary and website link neatly into a file on your computer.
***
You can run these files by the following command in your operating system's terminal:

[File Directory] python3 [File Name with .py extension]

Make sure you have the relevant Python modules installed!
